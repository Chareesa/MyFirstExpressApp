* Add Sniffers to check against JSDoc3: missing documentation, invalid tags and doc syntax
* Write a decent documentation, probably using Bootstrap 3.0 doc template
* Formalize ErrorCodes, probably following the pattern <ruleseName>.<ruleName>. References: phpcs
* Add Crockford's styles http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html
* Add missing tests for Sniffer, SyntaxAnalizer and other's contract validation
* Beautify tests following the pattern
describe("method",..
it ("must..."
it ("must..."
* Add experimental mode --resolve, it invokes Resolver instead of Reporter, that analyzes logger and tries to solve
	conflicts. It uses Replacer to apply changes on the code, and checks JavaScript validity with esprima before outputing the code
* Cli with https://npmjs.org/package/commander module
* Code browser in style of jscoverage (probably build it by using chunks array)
* Make a separate project using jscs and node-webkit to provide desktop UX. It allows to choose paths to test and
generate jscoverage like report to explore
