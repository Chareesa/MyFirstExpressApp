Static Express App
==================

This is a fun assignment I did for Code Fellows.
The requirements were "Create your own static file serving express app, include at least one link, one css style sheet and one javascript file".
I looked at some practice code from Mel Quark's JavaScript2 class to remember how to apply the event listener to multiple images.
